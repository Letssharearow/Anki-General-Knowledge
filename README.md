Ideas for further improvements (let me know if you want something of that)

- "Back" of the card showing the correct solution with color
- Answers are in random order
- solution is not revealed when clicking on the wrong answer
- simple front and back cards, without posible answers (issue is that many cards have "all of the above" which would be hard to find out)
- dynamic question-text-size
- Correct answer is easier to read (dark-mode issue)
